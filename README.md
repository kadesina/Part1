# Building a Logical Diagram for Visualization

## Objective
To design a comprehensive logical architecture and backend workflow for the lab environment by mapping out all system components, data flows, and integration points. This will ensure clarity in how logs, alerts, and automation interact across tools like Splunk, Active Directory, Shuffle, and Slackâ€”supporting effective detection, response, and analysis within a SOC-style setup.
